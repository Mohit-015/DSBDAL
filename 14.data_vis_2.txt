#Observations and Inference:
Age distribution by Gender:

Males and females have a somewhat similar age distribution, but the median age of males seems slightly lower than that of females.

Age distribution by Survival Status:

The median age of survivors tends to be lower for both males and females, especially noticeable for females. This suggests that younger passengers may have had a higher chance of survival.

Box plot interpretation:

The interquartile range (IQR) for the age of passengers who survived seems narrower than those who did not survive, especially for females.

Outliers: There are a few passengers with exceptionally high or low ages (outliers), but this is common in real-world datasets.

This box plot provides a visual way to compare the age distribution across different genders and survival statuses and helps identify patterns related to survival chances.
